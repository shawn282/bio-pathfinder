This is an implementation of an algorithm for finding the minimal number of enzyme steps between any two compounds.
An extensive set of enzymatic rules (based on the EC nomenclature) are used to generate paths between compounds. For any two compounds X and Y, we evaluated the minimal number of steps required to reach from one compound to the other. We begin with one compound, X, and generate all possible products using the EC classes. Then, in the following step, we generate in the same way all possible products for each of the molecules produced in the first step. The search is over when the required final compound Y was reached.
Every step multiplies the number of possible products by a factor of ~20 (depending on the chosen original molecule). This means that the complexity of the search grows exponentially with the distance from X to Y. In some cases the number of possibilities can reach several million. Therefore, the algorithm was made more efficient by simultaneously starting to generate products from both X and Y, and finishing the search when the ends meet - a bidirectional breadth-first search. The minimal path (or set of minimal paths) between X and Y is thus found.
